Each of the different colored AI Tanks currently in the Main scene of my UATanks project all have special tweaks 
that make them act differently.

This text document offers a description for all 4 of them to help whomever may need to know in the future. They are all named
after Pac-man ghosts except for the green one.

Fire Rate is actually the delay between each shot, lower numbers are better

Blinky (Red) -  Blinky is the fastest and most robust tank in the scene. She moves faster, turns faster, shoots faster, and
has more health than all of the other tanks. Blinky can sense the player from anywhere on the map and constantly chases
them down with malicious intent. If you are going to survive for more than a few minutes you must figure out a way to deal
with Blinky or succumb to her fearsome might. Because of her blinding speed Blinky does not handle obstacles well.
A wise player will use this to their advantage and will not be caught out in the open while Blinky is around.

Inky (Blue) - Inky is Blinky's devilish counterpart. Though she may be slower and seemingly not as robust as Blinky she does 
have her talents. Inky is the same color as player 1 and can cause confusion when she gets in close. Her slower movement
also allows her to deal with obstacles better than Blinky. She squeezes through and flushes the player out of their hiding
spot for her stronger sister to destroy. Inky will try to attack the player from their right side. If a player becomes too focused on the heavy hitter and forgets about her they
will regret it.

Greeny (Green) - At first glace Greeny may not seem too threatening. At the start of the game she will probably patrol around the 
edge of the field for a while as she cannot hear as well as the two previously mentioned tanks. But if she manages to sneak 
away from a fight she can heal up twice as fast! Because of this she is extremely brave and will stop fleeing in half
the time as the rest of the tanks. Greeny will always try to to sneak up behind the player.

Clyde (Yellow) - Clyde is not as smart or as perceptive as his sisters. In fact, he will probably miss the entire battle just 
patrolling around in his own world. It is safe to say that most of the time, he is not a threat. But, that doesn't mean
you should put your guard down. Clyde can turn just has fast as his sister Blinky and will catch confident players
off-guard if they are not watching their health. He isn't too smart so he will always try to come at players head on.
He is the most dangerous when an unaware player wanders into his path while battling his sisters. 
Players who pull him into the fray before taking down his sisters are sure to have a rough time surviving.
